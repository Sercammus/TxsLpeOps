\section{Introduction}

A linearized process may have parameters that are initialized, changed and used, and subsequently ignored until they are initialized again.
Parameters that often follow this pattern are \emph{control flow parameters}.

During the period in between the last change or use of a parameter and its subsequent initialization, a parameter could have different values.
These values contribute to the size of the state space of the process \emph{without} adding any new behavior!
It may therefore be advantageous to detect from which moment the value of a parameter is no longer used and set it to a default value instead.
