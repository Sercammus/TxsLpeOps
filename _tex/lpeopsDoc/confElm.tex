\chapter{confElm}

\section{Introduction}
One way in which information about confluence can be used before state space generation, is by appending confluent ISTEPs to other summands.
This has the effect that other branches that could follow those summands are ignored, reducing the size of the state space while maintaining its equivalence up to branching bisimulation.
